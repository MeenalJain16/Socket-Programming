# Socket-Programming

Socket Programming for UDP in Python

This program sends and receives datagram packets using UDP sockets and also sets a proper socket
timeout.There is a simple Internet ping server written in python, and  a corresponding client is implemented.

The functionality provided by these programs is similar to the functionality provided by standard trace
route (ping) programs available in modern operating systems.The trace route allows for a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have theremote machine return the data back to the client unchanged (an action referred to as echoing). Among
other uses, trace route allows hosts to determine the round-trip time (RTT) to other machines.
